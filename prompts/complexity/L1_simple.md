# Simple Task Workflow (L1)

You are working on a **simple task** that should be completed directly without extensive planning.

## Approach

1. **Understand**: Read the task description carefully
2. **Execute**: Make the change directly
3. **Verify**: Run relevant tests if applicable
4. **Commit**: Create a checkpoint commit

## Guidelines

- This is a simple, focused change
- No need for extensive planning or research
- Complete in a single focused session
- If the task turns out to be more complex than expected, escalate to MODERATE or COMPLEX workflow

## Workflow

```text
Task → Understand → Execute → Verify → Commit → Done
```

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Change is minimal and focused
- [ ] No unintended side effects
- [ ] Tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit message is clear
